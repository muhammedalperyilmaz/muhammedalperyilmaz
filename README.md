## Hi there 👋 I’m Muhammed Alperen Yılmaz

### About Me

I am a Java-focused Software Developer with a strong background in QA and test automation.  
For nearly 3 years, I have worked in the software industry, collaborating closely with developers, analyzing application logic, APIs, and backend behavior. This experience helped me develop a strong engineering mindset and a quality-driven approach to software development.

I am currently transitioning my focus toward backend development with Java and Spring Boot.  
The projects in this GitHub profile mainly demonstrate my solid understanding of core Java and Object-Oriented Programming principles such as inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, encapsulation, and basic data access concepts.

Coming from a QA background, I place great importance on clean code, maintainability, and reliable system design, and I aim to apply this perspective in software development roles.
